## 2026-09-26 - Avoid layout thrashing from getBoundingClientRect in requestAnimationFrame

**Learning:** Invoking `getBoundingClientRect()` inside a `requestAnimationFrame` loop on every frame forces synchronous layout recalculation/reflow (layout thrashing), especially when DOM style changes or transforms are applied in the same loop. Caching element bounding rectangles and invalidating them on `scroll`, `resize`, or when layout changes occur avoids unnecessary reflows and improves frame consistency and CPU/battery efficiency.

**Action:** Always cache layout measurements (`getBoundingClientRect`, `offsetHeight`, `offsetTop`) outside the main animation loop and invalidate/update the cache only when scrolling, resizing, or when explicit DOM layout shifts happen.
